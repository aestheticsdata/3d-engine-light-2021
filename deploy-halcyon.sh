# DEPLOY SCRIPT — halcyon
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ONE-TIME SERVER SETUP (ks-b):
#
# 1) Create releases directory:
#    sudo mkdir -p /var/www/halcyon/releases
#
# 2) Create initial symlink (required for first deploy):
#    sudo ln -s /var/www/halcyon/releases /var/www/halcyon/current
#
# 3) Ensure nginx serves the "current" symlink. The app has its own
#    subdomain, so this is a server block of its own rather than a
#    location under the studio site:
#    server {
#        server_name halcyon.1991computer.com;
#        root /var/www/halcyon/current;
#        index index.html;
#        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
#    }
#
# After any nginx configuration change:
#    sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# USAGE:
#   ./deploy-halcyon.sh
#   ./deploy-halcyon.sh rollback
#
# NOTES:
# - This script performs a local Vite build, uploads the dist/
#   folder via rsync, and switches releases atomically.
# - Rollback is supported via symlink switching.
# - Every outcome is reported to Zeus — success, failure and both
#   kinds of rollback. See "Reporting to Zeus" below and the
#   contract in Zeus/docs/reporting/README.md. Reporting can never
#   fail a deploy: every step of it is swallowed.
# - A deploy refuses a working tree that is dirty or not level with
#   origin/master, because the report describes HEAD and an unclean
#   tree would make it a lie.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# `-E` so the ERR trap installed below is inherited by functions and subshells; without it a
# failure inside `rollback_auto` or the build would exit silently and Zeus would hear nothing.

# report naming an app the registry has never heard of — so halcyon's registry row has to land
# before the next deploy for that deploy to be recorded. An unregistered *role* it records with a
# warning instead, because that means the registry is behind ks-b and dropping it would hide
